Forgot to write this into the program itself, but:
s saves board state, l loads board
You can only save one board at a time
I could probably allow it for saving multiple boards but do we really wanna bother
(Also, if you try to load before saving the program will fucking *die* but I'm not sure if this is a big deal)
Everything should be working, tho, so that's cool
